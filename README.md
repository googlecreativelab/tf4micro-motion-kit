# TF4Micro Motion Kit

This repo contains the Arduino Sketch and a Web Bluetooth API for loading models and running inference on the device.

## Install and Run on Arduino

Flashing: Using the Arduino Nano Sense 33 BLE

1. Install the [Arduino IDE ](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software "Arduino IDE")

2. Setup Arduino board:
-  Plug in the board
- Install the board by navigating to Tools > Board > Boards Manager and search for  Arduino Mbed OS Nano Boards. Full instructions (including drivers required for Windows) [here.](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/NANO33BLESense/ "Arduino Guide")
- FAQ for connection problems can be found [here.](https://github.com/tinyMLx/appendix/blob/main/ArduinoFAQ.md "Arduino Guide") 
- After the board is installed, select it under to Tools > Board >  Arduino Mbed OS Nano Boards > Arduino Nano 33 BLE

- Select the port by navigating to Tools -> Port -> dev/cu... (Arduino Nano 33 BLE)
![Arduino Port](/readme_images/port.png)


3. Install Arduino libraries 
-  Navigate to Tools > Manage Libraries
- Search for and install:
- Arduino_LSM9DS1
- ArduinoBLE
- Arduino_TensorFlowLite
![Manage libraries](/readme_images/library.png)
![TensorFlow Lite Library](/readme_images/tflib.png)



4. Open the sketch and flash
- Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/tf4micro-motion-kit/releases/latest)
- Open the **arduino/tf4micro-motion-kit** <folder> and double click on <tf4micro-motion-kit.ino> file
- Click the Right arrow in the top left corner to build and upload the sketch.

- **Warning**: This process may take a few minutes. Also, warnings may populate but the upload should still succeed in spite of them.
- If the sketch is installed, the LED on the board should flash red and green. 


5. Go to the URL related to the experiment. The URL can be found below and play!

## Using the TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers Kit by SparkFun
 
The board that comes with the TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers Kit by SparkFun comes preflashed with a sketch that will work with some of the experiments right out of the box. If you are using one of the “TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers” kits and you just want to jump right into playing with the experiments then you can simply connect your arduino to a power source (USB or Battery) and connect to one of the following experiment URLs:
- [Air Snare](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/air-snare/view "Air Snare")
- [Finger User Interface (FUI)](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/finger-user-interface/view "FUI")
- [Tiny Motion Trainer](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/tiny-motion-trainer/view "Tiny Motion Trainer")

## Web API Usage

Either use the button.js module to create a button that will connect and transfer your model together with your setting to the arduino over BLE,

Example:
```
import connectButton from "./tf4micro-motion-kit/web/button";

function handleGesture({index, value, velocity}){
   console.log(index, value, velocity);
}

function handleTransferProgress(progress){
  console.log(`Loaded ${Math.round(progress * 100)}%`);
}

connectButton(containerElement, {
   model: "./model.tflite",
   numClasses: 4,
   threshold: 0.169,
   numSamples: 10,
   captureDelay: 125,
   onGesture: handleGesture,
   onTransferProgress: handleTransferProgress,
   useMagnetometer: true
 }).addEventListener("click", () => {
   soundManager.userInit();
 });
```
or

Use the full api module (either by importing index.js or whatever functions you need from api.js)

## Run Test Pages:
1. Build and upload the Sketch in the arduino folder to your BLE 33 Nano Sense
2. Run: 
    * `$ cd web`
    * `$ sh serv.sh`

You need a live-server, and either python 2 or 3 installed

Then go to localhost:9090 in your browser and follow instructions
